## Installation

You need Node.js installed on your computer.
And VSCode as an Editor.


After cloning, or downloading the zip file, on GitHub (green button `<> Code`) open your terminal, and run:

to install all the dependencies.
"node_modules" folder will appear at the left in the Explorer files in VsCode.

Then run:

```bash
