Plato's Cave
---
Plato's Cave is an interactive 3D web gallery filled with some of the artwork from some of my favorite artists in history.



## Installation

You need Node.js installed on your computer.
And VSCode as an Editor.


After cloning, or downloading the zip file, on GitHub (green button `<> Code`) open your terminal, and run:

```bash
  npm install
```

to install all the dependencies.

Navigate to src
```bash
cd src
```

Then run:

```bash
  npx vite
```
to start the gallery.
